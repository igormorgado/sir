Pythoh SIR Model simulation
===========================


# randomwalk.py

A sample random walk simulation to test stochastic optimization methods

# sir.py

Module to run stocastic and deterministic sir simulations

# timeitplot.py

Module to graph performance data 


# experiment_paper_cba.py

Creates the images for the paper to CBA


# Notes

Images should be plotted as 300 dpi. Sizes should be

  [6, 4.24]
  [3, 2.125]
  [6, 3.375]
  [3, 1.6875]

These sizes keep the font size optimal for paper. Pay attention that 3xN data
are very small and legend should not be drawn.
